      "\u001b[1mAfter earthquakes, Puerto Rico’s major power plant to stay dark\u001b[0m\n",
      "\n",
      "Puerto Rico‘s top energy executive on Thursday warned that the United States territory’s largest power plant could remain off line for up to a year because of earthquake damage, evoking memories of lengthy power outages that followed a pair of hurricanes in 2017.\n",
      "Two days after being hit by Puerto Rico’s most powerful earthquake in more than a century, only half of the Caribbean island had power restored, Jose Ortiz, executive director of the public utility Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), told the island’s WKAQ radio.\n",
      "The PREPA-owned Costa Sur plant near the quake’s epicentre was seriously damaged and could remain off line “perhaps up to one year”, Ortiz said, raising the prospect of bringing in temporary generators with aid from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n",
      "A series of earthquakes, including one of 6.4 magnitude early Tuesday, rocked Puerto Rico. Periodic aftershocks continue to rattle the island of three million people, which has yet to fully recover from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Those storms, both in 2017, killed nearly 3,000 people.\n",
      "At the same time, Puerto Rico is going through a wrenching bankruptcy process to restructure about $120bn of debt and pension obligations, and it was roiled by political instability in August when former Governor Ricardo Rossello resigned following massive street protests over derisive private-chat messages that he shared with those in his inner circle.\n",
      "PREPA, also known by its Spanish AEE, is in arrears on some $9bn in debt, and now faces up to a year without energy from Costa Sur, which has a capacity of 990 megawatts.\n",
      "“Costa Sur is a disaster,” Ortiz said. “There is structural damage and damage to equipment. Repairs could take months, perhaps up to one year. It’s really unsafe to be there right now. It’s life-threatening. Yesterday when we were inspecting it with the people from FEMA we had to leave when an aftershock started.”\n",
      "Without the Costa Sur facility, Puerto Rico would need the rest of its power plants to operate at or near peak capacity to meet demand.\n",
      "Puerto Rico endured lengthy power outages following Hurricane Maria, exacerbating the humanitarian disaster.\n",
      "Nearly a year passed before electricity generation approached pre-hurricane levels, according to a November report by the US Energy Information Administration.\n",
      "Puerto Rico also relied on temporary generators following the hurricanes. Ortiz said PREPA was looking for a company to supply them.\n",
      "The quakes killed at least one person, destroyed or damaged about 300 homes, and led Governor Wanda Vazquez to declare a state of emergency.\n",

      "Rescuers continue to dug through heavy blocks of concrete with their bare hands early on Saturday, in a desperate search for survivors from a powerful earthquake that levelled buildings across Greece and Turkey, killing at least 26 people.\n",
      "Much of the damage in Turkey occurred in and around the Aegean resort city of Izmir, which has three million residents and is filled with high-rise apartment blocks. It was unclear how many people were trapped in the rubble.\n",
      "The quake also caused a mini-tsunami on the Aegean island of Samos and a sea surge that turned streets into rushing rivers in one town on Turkey’s west coast.\n",
      "Turkish officials confirmed 24 dead and nearly 800 injured after the quake hit the coastal province of Izmir.\n",
      "In Greece, two teenagers – a boy and a girl – were killed on the island of Samos when a building collapsed on top of them.\n",
      "“Words fail when children are lost. In these difficult hours, our thoughts turn to their families and Samos experiencing unbearable pain,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.\n",
      "People flooded onto the streets in the Turkish city of Izmir after the magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit, witnesses said. The wreckage of multiple-story buildings in the city’s centre could be seen with people climbing out to escape. Smoke rose into the sky in several areas.\n",

      "Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer told CNN Turk about 20 buildings collapsed. The city is the third-largest in Turkey with about 4,5 million residents. Turkey’s interior minister tweeted six buildings in Izmir were destroyed.\n",
      "Izmir Governor Yavuz Selim Kosger said at least 70 people had been rescued from the wreckage. He said four buildings were destroyed and more than 10 collapsed, while others also were damaged.\n",
      "Search-and-rescue efforts were continuing in at least 12 buildings.\n",
      "Ilke Cide, a doctoral student who was in Izmir’s Guzelbahce region at the time of the earthquake, said he went inland after waters rose after the earthquake.\n",
      "“I am very used to earthquakes … so I didn’t take it very seriously at first but this time it was really scary,” he said, adding the earthquake lasted for at least 25 seconds.\n",
      "The earthquake triggered a small-scale tsunami in Seferihisar district, Huseyin Alan, head of Turkey’s Chamber of Geological Engineers, told state news agency TRT, warning people to stay away from buildings.\n",
      "Footage on social media showed debris including refrigerators, chairs, and tables floating through streets on the deluge. TRT Haber showed cars being dragged by the water and piled on top of each other.\n",
      "AFAD said it was a magnitude 6.6 earthquake, while the US Geological Survey said it was 7.0. It struck at about 11:50 GMT and was felt along Turkey’s Aegean coast and the northwestern Marmara region.\n",
      "People search for survivors in the coastal province of Izmir in Turkey [Tuncay Dersinlioglu/Reuters]The US Geological Survey said the depth was 10 kilometres (six miles) and the epicentre was 33.5km (20.8 miles) off Turkey’s coast.\n",
      "Ali Yerlikaya, governor of Istanbul where the earthquake was also felt, said there were no reports of damage there.\n",
      "Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Turkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, an earthquake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500.\n",
      "The foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece pledged on Friday to help each other in rescue and recovery efforts. The two countries have been locked in a dispute over eastern Mediterranean energy rights.\n",
      "“Greek Foreign Minister [Nikos] Dendias called our minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to wish him the best. Both ministers stressed they were ready to help each other in case of need,” the Turkish foreign ministry said.\n",
      "Two teenage students were killed on the Greek island of Samos when the wall of a building collapsed. Media reports said the two victims, the first reported in Greece, were aged 15 and 17, and were walking home from school in the port of Vathy when it struck.\n",
      "“Two unconscious youngsters were pulled from the rubble of a collapsed wall and taken to hospital for identification,” the fire service said.\n",
      "The earthquake was felt across the eastern Greek islands and even in the capital, Athens.\n",
      "“We have had many earthquakes in the past, however, I have never felt one that has lasted this long,”  Anna Makris, a school counselling coordinator in Athens, told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "“There is a real sense of panic and now we are worried about aftershocks,” Makris added.\n",
      "Greek media said residents of Samos and other islands fled their homes, while some rockfalls were reported.\n",

      "Public television ERT reported the earthquake caused a mini-tsunami on Samos and a number of buildings were damaged.\n",
      "A resident of the Greek island Ikaria, right next to Samos, told Al Jazeera she ran out of her house after “the earth started moving”.\n",
      "“Some people screamed and started crying while others were trying to gather everyone to a safe location in fear that buildings would collapse,” she said, asking not to be named. “There are quite a  few damaged buildings and there were landslides on different parts of the island.”\n",

      "The overall death toll reached 111 on Monday after teams found more bodies overnight and Monday morning amid the rubble in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city.\n",
      "More than 1,000 people were injured in the quake, which was centred in the Aegean Sea, northeast of the Greek island of Samos. It killed two teenagers on Samos and injured at least 19 other people on the island.\n",
      "More than 898 wounded victims have so far been discharged from hospitals, according to Turkey’s disaster and emergency authority (AFAD).\n",
      "More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds were supplied to provide temporary shelter in Izmir, it added.\n",
      "Early Monday, nearly 65 hours after the quake, three-year-old Elif Perincek was pulled from the debris in the Bayrakli district of western Izmir province.\n",
      "Elif was the 106th person to be rescued from the rubble and was taken to hospital, Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency reported.\n",
      "Rescue workers clapped and cheered as a 14-year-old girl was also extricated from another collapsed building, Turkey’s IHA private agency reported.\n",
      "Idil Sirin was pulled out of the remains of Emrah Apartment, where she was under the rubble for 58 hours with her sister Ipek Sirin, 8, who did not survive, NTV television reported.\n",
      "Sirin was rushed off to hospital immediately after her rescue.\n",

      "Elif’s mother, Seher Dereli Perincek, her 10-year-old twin siblings Ezel and Elzem, as well as their seven-year-old brother Umut were pulled from the rubble 23 hours after the earthquake struck. Umut later died while the mother and children are receiving medical care.\n",
      "Turkey, which is among the world’s most seismically active zones, is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey.\n",
      "There has been some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The US Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while Istanbul’s Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9, and Turkey’s emergency management agency said it measured 6.6.\n",
      "Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage resulting in deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is under way in Turkish cities, but it is not happening fast enough.\n",
      "The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Greece’s Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Scientists are now analysing seismic data in an effort to understand the strongest earthquake to hit Nepal in more than 80 years, which has left more than 3,000 people dead.\n",
      "The Earth’s crust is made of large tectonic plates. These land masses, which sometimes include whole continents, are constantly moving and bumping into each other.\n",
      "Nepal straddles the fault line between two of these plates; the Indian and the Eurasian plates. These are being forced up against and under each other, at a rate of about 5cm each year.\n",
      "That may not sound like very much, but there is tremendous force behind them and when this builds up, an earthquake results.\n",
      "“This is probably the biggest earthquake to hit Nepal since 1934,” Brian Baptie of the British Geological Survey told Al Jazeera.\n",
      "“Earthquakes of this size are capable of causing an incredible amount of devastation.”\n",
      "Saturday’s earthquake is likely to be especially damaging because it was both strong and shallow.\n",
      "The depth of a quake frequently determines how much shaking is felt. In this case, the quake occurred just 11km beneath the surface, causing violent tremors in the immediate area.\n",
      "“This is a very large earthquake in a significantly populated region with infrastructure that has been damaged in past earthquakes,” Paul Earle, a US Geological Survey seismologist, said.\n",
      "“Significant fatalities are expected.”\n",
      "The mountainous terrain is likely to have resulted in even more damage.\n",
      "Layer of clay\n",
      "The heavily populated Kathmandu valley has a 300-metre-deep layer of clay beneath it.\n",
      "This reflects and focuses the seismic waves of an earthquake within the valley, resulting in what is known as soil liquefaction.\n",
      "This occurs when vibrations cause solid ground to turn in to something like quicksand.\n",
      "As a result, buildings and roads can be swallowed by the earth.\n",
      "“We know roughly where earthquakes occur, and how often they occur,” Baptie said.\n",
      "“That helps plan accordingly so it’s possible to construct buildings to minimise the amount of damage. It’s also possible for communities to become more resilient if they are aware.”\n",
      "Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and little of this earthquake preparation work had been done.\n",
      "“It was sort of a nightmare waiting to happen,” said seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the University of Cambridge in England, who was attending an earthquake preparedness meeting in Kathmandu last week.\n",
      "“Physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen.”\n",
      "Scientists say the area can expect at least 35 5+ magnitude aftershocks over the next few days and weeks.\n",
      "These have the potential to destroy already-damaged buildings.\n",
      "They also warn of the risk of landslides. Some have already been caused by the quakes.\n",
      "Others are likely to happen during the upcoming monsoon season.\n",

      "At least one person had been killed and 43 injured when a magnitude 6.6 earthquake shook the central Philippines, damaging buildings and roads and sending residents fleeing their homes.\n",
      "The shallow quake struck southeast of Masbate Island in the Bicol region at 8:03am (00:03 GMT) on Tuesday, the US Geological Survey said.\n",
      "“There are a lot of damaged houses,” said Staff Sergeant Antonio Clemente in Cataingan, a town of about 50,000 people on the impoverished island several kilometres west of the epicentre in the Samar Sea. “It was really strong.”\n",
      "According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the quake hit about five kilometres (three miles) from Cataingan at a depth of about 21 kilometres (13 miles).\n",
      "Local radio station reporter Christopher Decamon said he saw emergency workers pull the body of a retired police officer from the rubble of a three-story house on the outskirts of Cataingan. The man’s wife escaped unharmed.\n",
      "Police confirmed the man’s death. Sixteen people were also injured in the town.\n",
      "The earthquake “was really strong, our people were broadcasting at the time, but they just ran out of the building”, Decamon told AFP news agency by telephone.\n",
      "In nearby Palanas, at least 27 people were injured after being hit by falling objects or when their motorcycles crashed, Chris Adique, a municipal disaster officer, told DZBB radio.\n",
      "Search-and-rescue efforts were still under way in the region.\n",
      "The quake struck as the archipelago battles surging numbers of coronavirus infections, with more than 164,000 cases and restrictions on movement that vary across the country.\n",
      "A lockdown affecting a quarter of the population, including the capital Manila, will be eased Wednesday.\n",
      "“We’ve spoken to several officials on the ground who say that rescue operations in Cataingan are well under way,” said Al Jazeera’s Jamila Alindogan, reporting from the capital Manila.\n",
      "“Officials have raised the alert to four volcanoes in many parts of the southern and central parts of Luzon, where it remains to be seen whether the effect of these volcanoes are in direct relation to the earthquake,” she added.\n",
      "So far, the Philippine seismology office has recorded at least 24 aftershocks, with the strongest registering at a magnitude of 3.8.\n",
      "A video posted on Facebook and verified by AFP showed light damage to a food market in Cataingan.\n",
      "Overturned buckets and small fish were scattered on the ground, and chunks of cement had fallen from a pillar. People stood outside on the street.\n",
      "Philippine Red Cross chairman Richard Gordon tweeted photos taken by his colleagues showing buildings in Cataingan with corrugated iron roofs fallen in.\n",
      "Other photos taken in nearby Uson town show a sealed road with a large crack across it.\n",
      "The Philippines is situated on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.\n",
      "It is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.\n",
      "A magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southern island of Mindanao in December, killing at least three people, injuring dozens and damaging buildings.\n",

      "A magnitude 7.3 earthquake has struck off Japan’s east coast, rattling a region hit by a powerful 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown just weeks before the disaster’s 10th anniversary.\n",
      "The earthquake on Saturday produced powerful shaking along the coast and was felt strongly in the capital, Tokyo, but triggered no tsunami alert.\n",
      "Its epicentre was off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60km (36 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It shook buildings for some time after it hit, shortly after 11pm (14:00 GMT).\n",
      "Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told an emergency meeting of the cabinet on Sunday morning that the late-night quake had injured many people in the Fukushima and Miyagi regions.\n",
      "“But so far we have not received any reports of deaths,” he said.\n",
      "Japan’s disaster agency said 74 injuries had been reported in the region and also around Tokyo, but local media counted at least 104 reported injuries, from broken bones to cuts from shattered glass.\n",

A handful of people were reported to have sought shelter at evacuation centres.\n",
      "There were no immediate reports of significant damage to infrastructure, though local news broadcast images of a landslide on a highway.\n",
      "Approximately 950,000 homes lost power throughout the affected region, with the blackouts appearing to be concentrated in northeast Japan, including Fukushima and neighbouring prefectures.\n",
      "A worker cleans up broken bottles at a liquor shop after a strong quake in Fukushima, Japan, February 13, 2021 [Kyodo/via Reuters]No abnormalities were reported at the Fukushima nuclear plant, which melted down in the wake of the 2011 disaster, or at the Kahiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, according to owner Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings.\n",
      "“We are working quickly to collect information but we still have no details to announce. There were some unconfirmed reports about landslides but we are still checking,” Mikihiro Meguro, an official from the Fukushima prefectural government, told the AFP news agency.\n",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato addressed reporters after midnight and said evaluations were under way.\n",
      "“As far as damage, casualties and structural damage are being assessed,” he said, adding that sections of the bullet train service had been suspended due to power outages.\n",
      "“Surveys are being done at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant,” Kato added. “We have received reports that Onagawa nuclear plant and Fukushima Daichi nuclear plant are not showing any abnormality.”\n",
      "Images posted online showed broken glass at a shop and items spilled off the shelves at a supermarket.\n",

      "Renowned author Yu Miri, who lives in Fukushima’s Minamisoma city, tweeted a photo of her home, showing books, potted plants and other belongings strewn across the floor.\n",
      "“My house in Odaka, Minamisoma city is all messed up,” she wrote.\n",
      "“I hear the ground rumbling. And another quake,” she tweeted about an aftershock.\n",
      "Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the most seismically active areas on Earth. Japan accounts for about 20 percent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.\n",
      "Triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake, a tsunami crashed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in March 2011, overwhelming reactor cooling systems and causing multiple meltdowns in the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n",
      "Nearly 20,000 people were killed or went missing and 160,000 lost their homes and livelihoods in the massive earthquake and tsunami, which sent radiation over a large area that forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate.\n",
